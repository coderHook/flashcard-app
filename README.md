# Flashcard-app

Flashcards on the user can choose a topic and randomly he will get the questions, being able after hovering the card to see the answer. 

##Features:

(checked are the ones that are implemented)

- [X] As a student I want to access the flashcard app from the internet (GitHub pages) so I can test myself anywhere I am.

- [x] As a student I want to see the answer to the question so I can see if I was right.

- [x] As a student I want to get a new questions without having to reload the page so I’m not dependent on continuous internet connection.

 - [x] As a student I want to add my own flashcards with a question and an answer so I can test myself with questions that I personally struggle with

- [x] As a student I want to be able to have different categories of flashcards, so I can study different subjects.

- [X] As a student I want to be able to delete flashcards so I can keep testing myself with relevant questions

- [X] As a student I want my new flashcards that I made to be stored when I leave the page so I can shut down my browser (hint: you might want to use localstorage since we haven’t made apis yet, if you want to use an api checkout jsonbin)
